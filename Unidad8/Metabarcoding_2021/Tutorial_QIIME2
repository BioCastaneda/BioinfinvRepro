Hola!!!

En este tutorial utilizaremos el porgrama QIIME 2 para analizar y visualizar secuencias de ADN provenientes de muestras bacterianas, la cuales deben estar en formato fastq.



Here, we will utilize a pipeline called QIIME (v2) to analyze and visualize microbial diversity using raw DNA sequences in fastq files. In contrast to QIIME 1, QIIME 2 features several new ways of analyzing NGS data and has been modified significantly bioinformatically, but NOT biologically.

Below is a list of a few terms you should know when utilizing QIIME 2.

Action - a generic term for a method or visualizer.
Artifact - zipped input or output data for QIIME actions. Artifacts have file extension .qza.
Parameter - an input to an action. For instance, --p-trim-left is a parameter that takes in an integer value for any number of bases that the user wishes to trim off from the start of the sequence.
Plugin - a general term for an external tool that is built around QIIME 2.
Visualization - output data from a QIIME visualizer that have file extension .qzv. These can be viewed online.
Please use this pipeline if your fastq files are already demultiplexed - meaning each fastq file pairs (R1 and R2) represent sequences from ONE sample type.

Please also keep in mind that QIIME 2 is a work in progress; so some features may not yet be available. But rest assured that QIIME 2 team is working hard and should you have any uber specific questions we cannot answer, please sign-up and post them on the QIIME 2 forum.
